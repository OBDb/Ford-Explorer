generations:
  - name: "First Generation"
    start_year: 1990
    end_year: 1994
    description: "The original Ford Explorer was introduced as a replacement for the Bronco II, built on the Ranger pickup truck platform. Available as a two-door Sport model or four-door wagon, it featured traditional body-on-frame construction with Twin I-Beam front suspension and leaf-sprung rear axle. Initially powered by a 4.0L Cologne V6 engine producing 155-160 hp, paired with either a Mazda M5OD 5-speed manual or Ford A4LD 4-speed automatic transmission. Available with rear-wheel drive or part-time four-wheel drive using the Borg Warner Touch Drive system. The interior was more family-friendly than previous Ford SUVs, featuring a dashboard shared with the Ranger but with Explorer-specific door panels and seats. This generation played a pivotal role in popularizing the SUV concept for family transportation, establishing Ford as a leader in the growing midsize SUV market."

  - name: "Second Generation"
    start_year: 1995
    end_year: 2001
    description: "The redesigned Explorer maintained body-on-frame construction but with significant chassis upgrades, adopting a short/long-arm (SLA) wishbone front suspension replacing the Twin I-Beam setup, while retaining a leaf-sprung rear axle. The five-door model was produced from November 1994 through December 2000, while the three-door Explorer Sport continued until July 2003. Engine options expanded to include a 5.0L OHV V8 (210-215 hp) alongside the standard 4.0L Cologne V6 in both OHV (160 hp) and SOHC (210 hp) configurations. The four-wheel drive system was upgraded from Touch Drive to ControlTrac, an electronically controlled full-time system with a two-speed transfer case. A rear bench seat was available for export markets, expanding seating to seven passengers. This generation solidified the Explorer's position as America's best-selling SUV."

  - name: "Third Generation"
    start_year: 2002
    end_year: 2005
    description: "The third-generation Explorer marked a complete redesign, ending chassis commonality with the Ford Ranger in favor of a purpose-built SUV design (U152 platform). It introduced an independent rear suspension—a first for the mainstream American SUV segment—featuring a live axle located by two half-shafts, significantly improving ride quality and interior packaging with nearly 10 additional cubic feet of cargo space. Available exclusively as a five-door wagon, the model featured a redesigned interior with improved materials and standard dual airbags. Engine options included a 210 hp 4.0L SOHC V6 and a new 239 hp 4.6L SOHC Modular V8, paired with either a Mazda M5OD manual (2002 only) or Ford 5R55 automatic transmission. Safety features included AdvanceTrac stability control and optional side-curtain airbags. The Lincoln Aviator and Mercury Mountaineer were rebadged counterparts."

  - name: "Fourth Generation"

    end_year: 2010
    description: "The fourth-generation Explorer maintained body-on-frame construction on a new stiffer frame from Magna International, featuring updated front and rear fascias, side profile, interior redesigns, and a new one-piece tailgate replacing the problematic two-piece design. A tire pressure monitoring system and electronic stability control became standard equipment for improved safety. Power came from a 210 hp 4.0L SOHC V6 or a 292 hp 4.6L 24-valve Modular V8, paired with a 5-speed or new 6-speed Ford automatic transmission. The 2007 model year brought minor updates including an AUX input, heated windshield option, and the Ironman Package. The XLS trim was dropped, making XLT the base model. This would be the last generation with traditional body-on-frame construction and the final one produced at the Louisville, Kentucky and St. Louis, Missouri plants."

    end_year: 2015
    description: "The fifth-generation Explorer represented a paradigm shift, transitioning from traditional body-on-frame construction to unibody architecture based on Ford's D4 platform shared with the Flex and Lincoln MKT. This change resulted in significantly improved handling, ride quality, fuel economy, and interior space. Available exclusively as a five-door crossover SUV, it featured front-wheel drive or intelligent all-wheel drive with a variable center multi-disc differential. Powertrain options included a 290 hp 3.5L Ti-VCT V6 or a 240 hp 2.0L EcoBoost turbocharged four-cylinder (front-wheel drive only), paired with a 6-speed Ford automatic transmission. The interior offered three rows of seating for up to seven passengers with improved materials and technology including MyFord Touch infotainment system by Microsoft, SYNC connectivity, Sony audio, HD radio, and available navigation.

The facelift featured a redesigned front fascia, hood, and lower bumper with standard LED low-beam headlights inspired by the thirteenth-generation F-150. The rear received restyled LED tail lamps and dual exhaust outlets. A major mechanical change upgraded the four-cylinder engine from 2.0L to a more powerful 280 hp 2.3L EcoBoost sourced from the Mustang, while the 365 hp twin-turbo 3.5L EcoBoost V6 became available beyond just the Sport trim. A new Platinum trim level was introduced, featuring enhanced luxury content including a 500-watt Sony surround sound system, hands-free liftgate, and advanced parking assist.
