    description: "The original Ford Explorer was introduced as a replacement for the Bronco II, built on the Ranger pickup truck platform. Available as a two-door Sport model or four-door wagon, it featured traditional body-on-frame construction. Initially powered by a 4.0L V6 engine paired with manual or automatic transmissions and either rear-wheel or four-wheel drive. The interior was more family-friendly than previous Ford SUVs, helping to establish the Explorer as a practical alternative to minivans and station wagons. This generation played a pivotal role in popularizing the SUV concept for family transportation, despite controversy surrounding rollover incidents related to certain tire designs."

Available in two or four-door configurations, it offered more car-like features while maintaining utility. Engine options expanded to include a 5.0L V8 alongside the standard 4.0L V6. The interior was more upscale with improved materials and available features like leather seating and premium audio. This generation solidified the Explorer's position as America's best-selling SUV, appealing to families seeking a combination of practicality, capability, and image. The four-door model was also sold as the Mercury Mountaineer with upscale styling and features."

The exterior design was more refined with a sleeker appearance, while still maintaining traditional SUV proportions. Engine options included a 4.0L V6 and a new 4.6L V8, both with improved power and efficiency. The interior quality took a significant step forward with better materials and design. Safety features expanded to include stability control and side curtain airbags.

Power came from either a 4.0L V6 or a 4.6L V8, paired with a 5-speed or 6-speed automatic depending on the engine. The interior featured improved materials and available technology including navigation and rear-seat entertainment. Safety innovations included roll stability control and an available collision mitigation system. Despite these improvements, this generation faced increasing competition from car-based crossovers offering better fuel economy and handling, leading to declining sales toward the end of its production run."

This change resulted in significantly improved handling, ride quality, and interior space. Powertrain options evolved to focus on efficiency, including a naturally aspirated 3.5L V6, a 2.0L EcoBoost four-cylinder, and later a 3.5L EcoBoost V6 in Sport models. The interior offered three rows of seating with improved materials and technology, including the MyFord Touch infotainment system. Safety features expanded to include inflatable rear seatbelts and various driver assistance technologies. A significant refresh in 2016 updated the styling, improved interior materials, and introduced the SYNC 3 infotainment system.
