## Generations

The Ford Explorer has gone through six main generations since its introduction:

- **First Generation (1991-1994)**: Introduced as Ford's first four-door SUV built on a truck platform, the first-generation Explorer replaced the two-door Bronco II. It featured body-on-frame construction with available rear-wheel drive or four-wheel drive configurations. Engine options included a 4.0L V6 and later a 5.0L V8, establishing the Explorer as a popular family SUV that helped define the SUV market segment.

- **Second Generation (1995-2001)**: The second generation brought significant safety improvements and refinements while maintaining the truck-based platform. Notable changes included improved crash protection, updated styling, and enhanced interior space. The same 4.0L V6 remained the primary engine option, with the 5.0L V8 available in higher trims. This generation solidified the Explorer's position as America's best-selling SUV for much of the 1990s.

- **Third Generation (2002-2005)**: This generation introduced independent rear suspension for improved ride quality and handling, moving away from the solid rear axle of previous generations. The exterior received a more rounded, modern design while maintaining the Explorer's recognizable proportions. Engine options continued with the refined 4.0L V6 and an available 4.6L V8, with improved fuel economy and emissions compared to earlier generations.

- **Fourth Generation (2006-2010)**: The fourth generation featured a complete redesign with more contemporary styling and improved interior quality. It introduced the 4.0L V6 as standard with an available 4.6L V8, along with enhanced safety features and technology. This generation also saw the introduction of the Explorer Sport Trac pickup variant and maintained the body-on-frame construction that defined earlier Explorers.

- **Fifth Generation (2011-2019)**: Representing a major departure from previous generations, the fifth-generation Explorer transitioned to a unibody construction based on Ford's D4 platform, shared with the Ford Taurus. This change improved fuel economy, handling, and interior space while reducing weight. Engine options included a 3.5L V6, a turbocharged 2.0L EcoBoost four-cylinder, and a 3.5L EcoBoost V6. The design became more car-like while maintaining SUV proportions and three-row seating capability.

- **Sixth Generation (2020-present)**: The current generation moved to Ford's CD6 platform, featuring rear-wheel drive as standard with available all-wheel drive, marking a return to RWD-based architecture. The lineup includes a 2.3L EcoBoost four-cylinder as standard, with available 3.0L EcoBoost V6 and hybrid powertrains. Notable variants include the high-performance Explorer ST with a 400-hp twin-turbo V6 and the Explorer Hybrid offering improved fuel economy. The design emphasizes a more premium appearance with advanced technology features and improved towing capacity.
